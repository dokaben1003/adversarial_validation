# Adversarial Validation with Target Encoding

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of adversarial validation with target encoding techniques, provided within a Jupyter Notebook (`adversarial_validation_with_target_encoding.ipynb`). The primary focus is to demonstrate how adversarial validation can be utilized to assess the similarity of training and test datasets in predictive modeling, and how target encoding can be applied to categorical variables effectively.

## Installation
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.

## Usage
To use this notebook:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the adversarial_validation_with_target_encoding.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook/Lab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to understand the steps involved in adversarial validation and target encoding.


## How It Works
The notebook is divided into sections detailing each step of the process:

1. Data Loading: Load the datasets for modeling.
2. Preprocessing: Preprocess the data, focusing on handling categorical variables through target encoding.
3. Adversarial Validation: Implement adversarial validation to compare the training and testing datasets.
4. Modeling & Evaluation: Build a model using the prepared data and evaluate its performance.
